# Key-Logger
A simple program that helps you log your keystrokes.  

Key-Logger doesn't require *administrator* access to log keys. Also it has no dependencies on external libraries, unlike other programs that require *administrator access* even to install them.

## ðŸ”§ Enhanced Version Available

This repository now includes an **Enhanced Keylogger with Cursor Disruption Module** that simulates advanced malware behavior:

- **Traditional keylogging** with timestamp logging
- **Cursor disruption simulation** using pyautogui
- **Platform-specific cursor control** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Configurable disruption intensity** (low, medium, high)
- **Keyboard-triggered disruptions** on special keys
- **Comprehensive logging** of all activities

### Enhanced Features
- **Random cursor movement** to simulate user distraction
- **Cursor hiding/showing** using platform-specific APIs
- **Rapid movement patterns** to create confusion
- **Corner hiding tactics** to obscure cursor location
- **Background thread execution** for stealth operation

### Quick Start (Enhanced Version)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

python3 cursor_disruption.py

# Run enhanced keylogger
python3 enhanced_keylogger.py

# Test functionality
